## Exercises:

### Problem 1:

`Test if a list contains two elements which sum is equal to a specific value.`

Example:
the list [10, 15, 3, 7] and a key of 17 should output true
while [1, 8, 10, 21] and k = 19 should output false

|`3` tbc |O(n)
|`5` tbc |only one iteration

### Problem 2:

`Out of a list which symbolizes buildings aligned from east to west, and where value is the building heigth, guess how many building have appartments that are not completely obstructed and allow a view of the west.`

Example:
the list [3, 7, 8, 3, 6, 1] should output 3
and [1, 4, 5, 8] should output 1
